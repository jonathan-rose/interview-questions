;; ok, first off, I love this, great to do, super impressed

;; You code works, these functions do what they're emant to and for
;; the most part I would happily let them into any professional
;; codebase I'm working on.

;; you're doing a lot of (if (condition) ... ) at the start of your
;; functions to catch bad inputs, I would say that's a little out of
;; the ordinary for clojure code, generally we assume the things
;; coming in are good without being too strict on what it could
;; be. This lets us leverage 
;; different data types.

;; what you can do, if you still want these assertions is to add
;; `:pre` asserts to your function definition. But honestly you don';t
;; even see these in the wild that often.

(defn find-max
  [col]
  {:pre [(every? number? col)]}
  (apply max col))

(defn reverse-string
  [s]
  {:pre [(string? s)]}
  (-> s
      reverse
      str/join))

;; for the fizz-buzz example (where they specifically ask for
;; printing) it makes sense to use a `doseq`, but honestly if I for
;; some reasona actually wnated a fizz-buz function I would want it to
;; return a collection of values

(fizz-buzz- 15)
;; => [1
;;     2
;;     "Fizz"
;;     4
;;     "Buzz"
;;     "Fizz"
;;     7
;;     8
;;     "Fizz"
;;     "Buzz"
;;     11
;;     "Fizz"
;;     13
;;     14
;;     "FizzBuzz"]

;; or better yet, return a lazy sequence of all the values which I can
;; take the first n from
(take 15 (fizz-buzz))
;; => [1 2 etc. ]

;; finally I would say that your code is a little imperative (all the
;; `do`s and `doseq`s) and all the printing doesn't lend itself to
;; using these functions elsewhere (I know that's not the point of
;; them here). In general you would see functinos that just return the
;; value or `nil` if that value can't be computed.

(find-sum [1 2 3 4 5 6] 10)
;; => [4 6]

(find-sum [1 2 3] 1000)
;; => nil

;; Strings are already sequences, so you dont need to thread it through `(seq)`.
;; Also, when you thread through an expression that ahas no other arguments you 
;; can omit the parens, improves clarity a little.
